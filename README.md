# eebo_r
Doing R on the EEBO-TCP corpus.

This repository contains the code, data, and some outputs of R on EEBO-TCP phase 1. Check back for more tests, lessons, and experiments!

For right now, there is one exercise (counting word frequencies in Holinshed's Chronicles). The data to be analyzed is:
* holinshed-v1.xml
* holinshed.v2.xml

*The blog post with instructions will be posted soon, check back here.*

The final code from the blog post is at:
* holinshed_r.R

There is a point in the blog post where you may not want to wait for the code to fully run (it takes several minutes). The cooking-show version of the result can be found at:
* holinshed.txt

*TEST EDIT*
